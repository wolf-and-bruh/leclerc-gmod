My first attempt to create simple cheat, it's unstable, unfinished, so don't take it very seriously!

# (If you want to continue developing this cheat, you can fork it, but the name must be not same as this repository.)
# (If you want to ask some questions, feel free to contact me in discord: forsazh222222)
